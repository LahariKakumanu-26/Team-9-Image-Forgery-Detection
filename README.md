# Team-9-Image-Forgery-Detection
Image Forgery is manipulation of digital image to conceal meaningful information of the image. In 
the current digital age, creating and manipulating digital images are easy and simple by using 
processing tools which are widely available from the Internet.

The proposed method is a hybrid approach for image forgery detection using deep learning 
techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or as well as using Thepade's features in 
combination with machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Random 
Forests.
